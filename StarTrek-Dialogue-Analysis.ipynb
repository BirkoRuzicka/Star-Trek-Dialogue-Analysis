    "# Analysis of „Star Trek“ episode transcripts: Dialogue distribution by gender\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Data Science project by Dr. Birko-Katarina Ruzicka**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no secret that dialogue in movies and series has been unevenly distributed between genders this far ([Source 1](#Bibliography)), although surprisingly few studies have been conducted on the matter so far, and even fewer were published in peer-reviewed journals. Rare and beautiful examples for what could be done include \n",
    "* the outstanding work by Anderson and Daniels titled \"Film Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age\" ([Source 1](#Bibliography)), and \n",
    "* T. Bowe's \"Stargate SG1 Dialogue Text Analysis\" ([Source 2](#Bibliography)), in which he thoroughly analyses dialogue by character, speech content, and positive vs. negative sentiment across five seasons of a sci-fi show. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way: Both of these studies are also filled to the brim with beautiful Data Vizualisation graphics! \n",
    "\n",
    "As a lifelong \"trekkie\", I was curious as to how this was handled within the **Star Trek** franchise, a notoriously socially progressive format whose plotlines are frequently driven by themes of morality and tolerance. Star Trek's numerous shows and movies also conveniently cover roughly 60 years of social development. \n",
    "\n",
    "I analysed the transcripts of most Star Trek series for the ratio of male, female, and gender-neutral characters with speaking roles, as well as how many lines of dialogue are spoken by each gender. In particular, I focused on how this distribution changed over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the series I included in the study:\n",
    "\n",
    "|title |&nbsp;| abbreviation |&nbsp;| originally aired|\n",

    "## 1. Collecting and preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially was inspired by, and worked from, a dataset of \"Star Trek Scripts\" from Kaggle ([Source 3](#Bibliography)). While working with this data, however, I noticed some issues that required extensive cleaning, and some issues that I was unable to correct at all. Furthermore, having been created several years ago, the dataset did not include the most recent Star Trek series \"Discovery\" and \"Picard\" (which, spoiler!, have turned out to be pivotal to my analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a fit of perfectionism, I wrote my own Python webscraping algorithm to fetch the transcripts to transform the text into a clean, ready-to-use dataset in JSON format. The JSON file and the algorithm are available [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/BirkoRuzicka/Star-Trek-Transcripts).\n",

    "(***A note on code in this notebook:***\n",
    "*the examples of code I show here are not intended to represent a fully working model of my analysis, but rather to illustrate concepts. The full code is available on GitHub, please use this if you intend to recreate any of my work!*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the analysis, the contents of the JSON file are read into a Pandas dataframe. To prevent the code from being unnecessarily complex, I did this series-by-series. I will now show the code for creating the \"TOS\" segment of the dataframe:"

Notable examples of such episodes include \"The Outcast\" (TNG, season 5, episode 17) and \"Cogenitor\" (ENT, season 2, episode 22). Much could and should be said about gender expression in Star Trek, but that is not the scope of this project. If anyone reading this feels the calling to expand on this further, I fiercely encourage you to get in touch with me!*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the purpose of this study, I assigned characters the gender which they were expressing to the viewer. In almost every case, I found the characters' gender expression to be stereotypical, sometimes to an amusing degree. However, in the few ambiguous cases I relied on how the character referred to themselves or was referred to by another in dialogue, as well as background knowledge on the character. For example:*\n",
    "\n",
    "*- the ship's computer generally speaks in a female-coded voice (fellow trekkies will know that it was indeed the voice of Majel Barret, the wife of Gene Roddenberry himself). However, the computer never expresses gender, nor is it ever addressed as anything other than \"it\", so I classified it as genderneutral*\n",
    "\n",
    "*- the Voyager's \"Emergency Medical Hologram\" is a non-corporeal computer program, so it is not \"alive\" and does not have a gender in the conventional sense. But it is generally referred to as \"he\", the crew members treat it as a person, and we come to understand throughout the plot that it is evolving self-awareness as a male person. I therefore classified this character as male*\n",
